I am a PhD student with the Scene Understanding Group at [Mercedes-Benz R&D](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/de/), as well as the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en) and the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), where I am advised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](www.cvlibs.net). 

Previously I was a master's student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), where I completed my master's thesis at the [Department of Measurement and Control](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/index.php), supervised by [Prof. Christoph Stiller](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/mitarbeiter_stiller.php).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, robotics and computer vision. In particular, I am interested in learning robust representations for perception and planning from simulation.
