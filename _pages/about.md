I am a machine learning scientist with the Scene Understanding Group at [Mercedes-Benz R&D](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/de/), where I work as a tech lead on both pre-development of next-gen ADAS functions as well as AI research for automated driving. Previously I was a PhD student with the same group, as well as the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en) and the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), where I was advised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://cvlibs.net/).

Before my graduate studies, I was a master's student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), where I completed my master's thesis at the [Department of Measurement and Control](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/index.php), supervised by [Prof. Christoph Stiller](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/mitarbeiter_stiller.php).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, robotics and computer vision. In particular, I am interested in learning robust representations for perception and planning from simulation.
